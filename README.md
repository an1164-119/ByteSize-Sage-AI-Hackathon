Project Title: PulsePoint AI for the ByteSize Sage AI Hackathon

About the Project PulsePoint AI is a content intelligence platform created to help creators master the attention economy. The system uses Generative AI and multimodal models to take long educational videos and turn them into engaging, viral-ready vertical reels.

Key Features Our platform uses multimodal analysis powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to pinpoint emotional peaks and the most valuable golden nuggets of information within a video. To ensure the content is ready for mobile viewing, we use computer vision through MediaPipe to automatically track the speaker and maintain a perfect 9:16 vertical frame. Additionally, we use OpenAI Whisper to generate highly accurate, timed captions that keep viewers engaged.

Technical Stack The project is built using a robust set of tools including Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for the large language model and OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text. For the video processing and computer vision elements, we utilized MoviePy and MediaPipe. The entire user interface is built on the Streamlit web framework.
